# Servers

Wodby is not a hosting provider. We believe that there are plenty of reliable providers on the market already. You can connect your own servers from any hosting provider.

By connecting your server, you let Wodby install [infrastructure](../infrastructure/README.md) that will be used to deploy your apps.
