# Connecting droplet from DigitalOcean

Wodby provides a native integration with <a href="http://digitalocean.com" target="_blank">DigitalOcean (DO)</a>: 

1. Navigate to `Servers > Connect` from Wodby Dashboard and select DigitalOcean from the list of providers

2. Click `Connect my DigitalOcean account` button below and authorize Wodby access to your account
  
3. Choose droplet region, size and click `Create Droplet`
 
4. Wodby will spin a new droplet and automatically install all required infrastructure

> You will be able to access newly created droplet using SSH keys added to your DO account if you have any or you will receive email with credentials from DigitalOcean if you don't
