# Connecting Droplet from DigitalOcean

Wodby provides a native integration with <a href="http://digitalocean.com" target="_blank">DigitalOcean (DO)</a>: 

1. Connect your DigitalOcean account by adding a [new integration](../../integrations/README.md) 

2. Navigate to `Servers > Connect`, select DigitalOcean from the list of providers and your integration
  
3. Click proceed, choose droplet region, size and click `Create Droplet`
 
4. Wodby will spin a new droplet and automatically install all required infrastructure

> You will be able to access newly created droplet using SSH keys added to your DO account if you have any or you will receive email with credentials from DigitalOcean if you don't
