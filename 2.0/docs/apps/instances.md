# Instances

## What is application instance?
â€‹
Application instance is a single isolated copy of your application, that copy can have different environment type: production, staging, development. Every app can have an unlimited number of instances but at least one. You can deploy as many instances as you want. You can also deploy instances of the same applications across different clusters.

You can remove or add a new instance from the `Instances` page. To get there navigate to the instance page and click on a cogwheel in the header.
