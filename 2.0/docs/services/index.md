# Service

## Overview

Service (stack service) is a basic unit of a [stack](../stacks/index.md). Services have versions and manifests. Services can be added only by importing from a git repository. Most services have a template (Wodby template) and kubernetes manifests, however some types of services (like `config`) may not have kubernetes manifests.
