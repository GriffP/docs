# Getting started

Wodby was designed to help developers deploy and manage applications across any cloud in the simplest fashion. Before you deploy your first application make sure you've connected your cluster. Or you can use our demo cluster (all applications deployed to our demo server will be automatically destroyed after 12 hours).

Key concepts:

* [Application Instances](apps/instances.md)
* [Clusters](clusters/index.md)
* [Stacks](stacks/index.md)

How to:

* [Create your first application](apps/new.md)
* [Create your Kubernetes cluster](clusters/new.md)
