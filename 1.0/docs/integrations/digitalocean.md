## Connecting droplet

Wodby provides a native integration with DigitalOcean: 

1. Connect your DigitalOcean account via Wodby dashboard (`Integrations`) 

2. Navigate to `Servers > Connect`, select DigitalOcean from the list of providers and your integration
  
3. Click proceed, choose droplet region, size and click `Create Droplet`
 
4. Wodby will spin a new droplet and automatically install all required infrastructure

## Accessing droplet
 
You will be able to access newly created droplet using SSH keys from your DigitalOcean account, if you don't have any, we will add SSH keys from your Wodby profile, and if you neither have those, you will receive an email with root credentials from DigitalOcean
