# Automatic deployment

If you want to run deployment automatically every time you push code to a git branch (all instances using this branch will be deployed) follow these steps:

1. [Configure git hooks](../git/auto-deployment-hooks.md) for your git repository
2. Navigate to `App page > Deployment > Settings` tab of your instance page and check `Automatic deploy` option
