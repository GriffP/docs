# MariaDB stack documentation

MariaDB can be configured with the following [environment variables](https://github.com/wodby/mariadb#environment-variables)

## External access

There are two ways to connect to a MariaDB server externally: publish port or set up an SSH tunnel.  

### Publish port

Publish MariaDB's port (3306) from [stack configuration page](../../stacks/config.md#ports) to a dynamic node port and connect as:

```shell
mysql -h=[IP] -P[PORT] -u[USER] -p[PASSWORD] [DATABASE]
```

Where `[PORT]` is the generated node port (you can find it on a service page `App Instance > Stack > MariaDB`) and `[IP]` is the IP of the server where app instance deployed (or use the server hostname `node-[SERVER UUID].wod.by`).

### Set up tunnel

If you deploy MariaDB as a service inside of a stack that comes with an SSHD container, you can set up a secure tunnel:

1. Set up SSH tunnel on port `53306` (you can change it). You can find `[SSH Port]` on `Instance > Stack > SSH` page. For MariaDB (port `3306` by default) use the following command:    
    ```shell
    ssh -L 53306:mariadb:3306 -p [SSH Port] wodby@[Server IP] -N
    ```
2. Connect to the database via the tunnel on port `53306` (replace `[tokens]`):
    ```shell
    mysql --protocol=TCP -P53306 -u[USER] -p[PASSWORD] [DATABASE]
    ```
