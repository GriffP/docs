# MariaDB stack documentation

MariaDB can be configured with the following [environment variables](https://github.com/wodby/mariadb#environment-variables)

## Calculating the optimal size of `innodb_buffer_pool_size`

Run the following query to get the recommend innodb buffer pool size:

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(CEILING(RIBPS/POWER(1024,pw)),SUBSTR(' KMGT',pw+1,1))
Recommended_InnoDB_Buffer_Pool_Size FROM
(
    SELECT RIBPS,FLOOR(LOG(RIBPS)/LOG(1024)) pw
    FROM
    (
        SELECT SUM(data_length+index_length)*1.1*growth RIBPS
        FROM information_schema.tables AAA,
        (SELECT 1.25 growth) BBB
        WHERE ENGINE='InnoDB'
    ) AA
) A;
```

## External access

There are two ways to connect to a MariaDB server externally: publish port or set up an SSH tunnel.  

### Publish port

Publish MariaDB's port (3306) from [stack configuration page](../../stacks/config.md#ports) to a dynamic node port and connect as:

```shell
mysql -h=[IP] -P[PORT] -u[USER] -p[PASSWORD] [DATABASE]
```

Where `[PORT]` is the generated node port (you can find it on a service page `App Instance > Stack > MariaDB`) and `[IP]` is the IP of the server where app instance deployed (or use the server hostname `node-[SERVER UUID].wod.by`).

### Set up tunnel

If you deploy MariaDB as a service inside of a stack that comes with an SSHD container, you can set up a secure tunnel:

1. Set up SSH tunnel on port `53306` (you can change it). You can find `[SSH Port]` on `Instance > Stack > SSH` page. For MariaDB (port `3306` by default) use the following command:    
    ```shell
    ssh -L 53306:mariadb:3306 -p [SSH Port] wodby@[Server IP] -N
    ```
2. Connect to the database via the tunnel on port `53306` (replace `[tokens]`):
    ```shell
    mysql --protocol=TCP -P53306 -u[USER] -p[PASSWORD] [DATABASE]
    ```

## Local environment

### Import existing database

if you want to import your database, uncomment the line for `mariadb-init` volume in your compose file. Create the volume directory `./mariadb-init` in the same directory as the compose file and put there your `.sql .sql.gz .sh` file(s). All SQL files will be automatically imported once MariaDB container has started.

### Export

Exporting all databases:
```shell
docker-compose exec mariadb sh -c 'exec mysqldump --all-databases -uroot -p"root-password"' > databases.sql
```

Exporting a specific database:
```shell
docker-compose exec mariadb sh -c 'exec mysqldump -uroot -p"root-password" my-db' > my-db.sql
```
