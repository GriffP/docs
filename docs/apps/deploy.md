# Code deployment

Some stacks that have deployment orchestration provide the following options how you can deploy your code. 

## Direct git integration



### Auto-deployment on push

Available only for stacks with git integration. If you want to run deployment automatically every time you push code to a git branch (all instances using this branch will be deployed) follow these steps:

1. Configure git hooks for your git repository
2. Navigate to `Instance > Deployment > Settings` and check `Automatic deploy` option

## Deployment via third-party CI

## Wodby CI
