# Containers

Stacks provided by Wodby built with docker containers. Our containers are based on [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) in most cases, a lightweight Linux distribution. 

All containers images are public and hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/wodby/). The source code of images are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wodby/). We use [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/wodby/) to build our images.
