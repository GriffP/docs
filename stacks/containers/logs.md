# Containers logs

To get containers logs copy and execute `Show logs command` (`[Instance] > Stack > [CONTAINER]`) from a host server. Please note that some applications do not write all logs to output, e.g. Jira/Confluence/Cachet write some of their logs on a disk, in this case you would need to [access the container](access.md).
