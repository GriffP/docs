# Applications

Wodby was designed to help developers deploy and manage application across their servers in the most simple fashion. Before you deploy your first application make sure you've connected at least one [server](../servers/README.md) and a [git repository](../git/README.md).

Learn how to [deploy a new app](deploy.md). Wodby support the following list of applications:

* [Drupal](drupal/README.md) (version 6, 7, 8)
* [WordPress](wordpress/README.md)

> Every application deployed via Wodby has at least one instance. In other words, when we say app what we really mean is application instance. 

Further reading once the application is deployed:

* [Application instances](instances.md)
* [Domains](domains.md)
* [Backups](backups.md)
* [Remote workspace](remote-workspace/README.md)
* [Remote debugging](remote-debugging.md)
* [Maintenance mode](maintenance-mode.md)
* [Compiling Sass](sass.md)
* [Going live](going-live.md)
