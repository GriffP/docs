# Applications

The key functionality of Wodby is to let you deploy your applications in a simple fashion. Before you deploy your first application make sure you've connected at least one [server](../servers/README.md) and a [git repository](../git/README.md).

Learn how to [deploy a new app](deploy.md). Wodby support the following list of applications:

* [Drupal](drupal/README.md) (version 6, 7, 8)
* [WordPress](wordpress/README.md)
* NodeJS (coming soon)

> Every application deployed via Wodby has at least one instance. In other words, when we say app what we really mean is application instance. 

Further reading once the application is deployed:

* [Application instance](instance.md)
* [Domains](domains.md)
* [Backups](backups.md)
* [Remote workspace](remote-workspace/README.md)
* [Remote debugging](remote-debugging.md)
* [Maintenance mode](maintenance-mode.md)
