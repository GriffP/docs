# Applications

Wodby was designed to help developers deploy and manage application across their servers in the most simple fashion. Before you deploy your first application make sure you've connected at least one [server](../servers/README.md) and a [git repository](../git/README.md). Or you can use our demo server and git server (all applications deployed to our demo server will be automatically destroyed after 12 hours).

Learn how to [deploy a new app](deploy.md). 

> Every application deployed via Wodby has at least one instance. In other words, when we say app what we really mean is application instance. 

Further reading once the application is deployed:

* [Application Instances](instances.md)
* [Domains](domains.md)
* [Logs](logs.md)
* [SSL](ssl.md)
* [Backups](backups.md)
* [Maintenance mode](maintenance-mode.md)
* [Going live](going-live.md)
