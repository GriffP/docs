# Git repository

Every app on Wodby stores its code in a git repository. We provide our git server for demo purposes only. As an agnostic platform we encourage you to use your own git server. If you don't have a private git repo, we recommend using <a href="https://bitbucket.org" target="_blank">BitBucket</a>, it's free for small team with private repositories.
