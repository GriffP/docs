# FAQ

> How can I purchase a server?

Wodby is not a hosting provider. We believe that there are plenty of reliable providers on the market already. Instead we provide a way to [connect your own server](../servers/connect/README.md) from any cloud. 

> I have a large-scale application, how can you help me?

For large-scale application we have a [container-based cluster solution](../cluster/README.md).

> It's so complex, how do I start?

> Why does the team plan starts with 10 instances minimum?

We have a good reason for that, actually even 2 reasons:
 
1. When a person uses Wodby for production he expects a certain level of support which we can't provide for less than $50/mo. On the other hand we don't want to provide poor customers service. Quality > Quantity
2. We [upgrade your application bundles](../infrastructure/bundles/README.md) and [your server infrastructure](../infrastructure/versioning.md) which isn't always an automatic process and obviously exceeds $5/mo 

We want to provide the best developers experience for our customers but there's a minimum price for that.
