### Why does the team plan starts from $50

The team plan starts with 10 [instances](../apps/instances.md) minimum. And here is why â€“ when people use Wodby in production they expect a certain level of service which we can't provide for less than $50/mo. On the other hand we don't want to provide poor service.

Quality over quantity.

### How can I purchase a server?

Wodby is not a hosting provider. We believe that there are plenty of reliable providers on the market already. Instead we provide a way to [connect your own server](../servers/connect/README.md) from any cloud. 

### I have a large-scale application, how can you help me?

For large-scale application we have a [container-based cluster solution](../cluster/README.md).

### It's so complex, how do I start?

Watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMqjcU4cMPM" target="_blank">demo video</a>.

### Can I connect my own git repository?

Yes, please read [how-to instructions](../git/connect/README.md).

### What is bundle?

Bundle is a pre-configured infrastructure package for [your application](../../apps/README.md). You can learn more about bundles [here](../infrastructure/bundles/README.md).
