## Overview

Wodby provides subscriptions on per [application instance](../apps/instances.md) basis. You can find available pricing plans on <a href="https://wodby.com/pricing-plans" target="_blank">our billing page</a>. The price specified for 1 month (30 days).

## Free Trial

We offer 1 week free trials for paid subscriptions. To start a free trial you should add a bank card. During activation of your trial you'll have to choose a pricing plan with a billing period (monthly or annual). Once the trial expired your card will be automatically charged for the first month with the amount of the selected pricing plan.

If you cancel your subscription before the end of the trial your card won't be charged. 
  
## Bank Cards

We don't store your bank cards information. We use <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/is-stripe-pci-compliant" target="_blank">PCI compliant</a> third-party service <a href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a> to store cards information and process all the payments.

You can add only one card. If you want to change the attached card, just edit its information. 
 
If you want to delete attached card permanently please [contact our support team](../product/support.md).

## Billing

Wodby uses recurring payment for all the subscriptions. The subscriptions automatically renewed every billing period (month or year), the card attached to the organization charged automatically. After the card has been charged the invoice will be sent to the email address of the owner user who edited the card details last. 

If you cancel your subscription before the end of the current billing period your card won't be charged.

## Permissions

All owners of the organization can manage any cards and subscriptions inside of the organization.
