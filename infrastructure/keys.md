# Adding a public SSH key

If you want to work with your application you will need to add at least one public SSH key. Unless you have one, take a look at [this tutorial](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key) to find out how to generate one

Once you have it, go to `Profile > Keys > Add new key` page. Enter any key you like (it's for you) and copy your public key (with .pub extension) to the textarea.
