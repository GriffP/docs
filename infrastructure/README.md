# Infrastructure

When you [connect a server](../servers/README.md) to Wodby we deploy [container-based](containers/README.md) infrastructure to this server. This will further allow you to deploy infrastructure [for your applications](../apps/deploy.md) which we call [bundles](bundles/README.md). 

Both server infrastructure and bundles have versioning. We regularly update them by releasing [newer versions](versioning.md), such updates can include security updates and performance improvements. 

Basic concepts:

* [Infrastructure versioning](versioning.md)
* [Bundles](bundles/README.md)
* [Containers](containers/README.md)
