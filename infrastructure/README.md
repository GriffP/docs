# Infrastructure

When you [connect a server](../servers/connecting-server/README.md) to Wodby we deploy [container-based](containers/README.md) infrastructure to this server. This infrastructure will further allow you to [deploy apps](../apps/deploy.md) by installing their [bundles](bundles/README.md). 

The infrastructure deployed to your server has a [version](versioning.md). We regularly update the infrastructure we provide by releasing [newer versions](versioning.md), such updates can include security updates and performance improvements. 

Basic concepts:

* [Infrastructure versioning](versioning.md)
* [Bundles](bundles/README.md)
* [Containers](containers/README.md)
