# Bundle versioning

Every application instance has its own [bundle](README.md) version. You can find the version of the bundle on settings page of your instance. On this page you will see whether or not your bundle is outdated. If you want perform the upgrade of your instances' bundles please [contact our support team](../../product/support.md) to schedule the upgrade.
 
The bundle has a requirement for a minimal [version of infrastructure](../versioning.md) of the server where this bundle is deployed.
