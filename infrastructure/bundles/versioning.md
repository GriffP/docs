# Bundle versioning

We constantly improve the bundles infrastructure. You can see the version of the bundle on the apps list page. It's not always possible to update the bundle automatically so if you want perform the upgrade please [contact our support team](../../product/support.md) to schedule the upgrade.
 
The bundle has a requirement for a minimal [version of infrastructure](../versioning.md) of the server where this bundle is going to be deployed.

You will be notified each time a new version of the bundle is released.
