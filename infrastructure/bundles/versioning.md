# Bundle versioning

Every application instance has its own [bundle](README.md) version. You can find the version of the bundle on the `Settings` tab of your instance. On this page you will also find the indicator when your bundle is outdated. If you want perform the upgrade of your instances' bundles please [contact our support team](../../product/support.md) to schedule the upgrade.
 
The bundle has a requirement for the minimal [version of infrastructure](../versioning.md) of the server where this bundle is deployed.
